# Manzana QA Report (v0.1.1)

**Date**: 2026-01-06
**Executor**: QA Team
**Target Version**: 0.1.1

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The QA cycle for Manzana v0.1.1 has been completed. The codebase is **compilable**, **lint-free**, and **passes all 120 existing tests**. However, a structural deviation from the specification was detected in the `tests/` directory layout.

## 2. Test Execution Results

| Test Suite | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Status |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Unit Tests** (lib.rs) | 80 | 80 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| **Integration Tests** | 12 | 12 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| **Property Tests** | 18 | 18 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| **Documentation Tests** | 10 | 10 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| **Total** | **120** | **120** | **0** | **100% PASS** |

## 3. Code Quality Gates (Jidoka)

- **Compilation** (`cargo check`): ✅ PASS
- **Static Analysis** (`cargo clippy`): ✅ PASS (No warnings)
- **Formatting** (`cargo fmt`): ⚠️ FAILED initially (Fixed automatically during QA)
- **Safety**: `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is enforced in `src/lib.rs`.

## 4. Specification Compliance & Deviations

### ✅ Verified Hypotheses
- **F017**: Graceful degradation on missing hardware (Verified by `test_f017_graceful_degradation_on_missing_hardware`).
- **Memory Safety**: Property tests verify error handling and invariant preservation, supporting **Category 1** hypotheses.

### ⚠️ Structural Deviation detected
**Issue**: The directory structure does not match "Appendix B" or "Section 2.2" of the Specification.

- **Spec Requirement**:
  ```text
  tests/
  ├── unit/
  ├── integration/
  ├── property/
  └── falsification/
  ```
- **Current State**:
  ```text
  tests/
  ├── integration_tests.rs
  └── property_tests.rs
  ```

**Impact**: The "100-Point Popperian Falsification Checklist" (Section 8) requires a dedicated `falsification/` directory for rigorous hypothesis testing, which is currently missing.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Restructure `tests/`**: Move `integration_tests.rs` to `tests/integration/` and `property_tests.rs` to `tests/property/`.
2.  **Implement Falsification Suite**: Create `tests/falsification/` and begin populating it with tests mapping directly to F001-F100 hypotheses.
3.  **Continuous Integration**: Ensure `cargo fmt --check` is added to the CI pipeline to catch formatting regressions early.

**Status**: APPROVED for development continuation (pending structure fix).
